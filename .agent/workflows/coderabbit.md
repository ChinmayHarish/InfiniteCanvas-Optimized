# CodeRabbit Review Workflow

This workflow guides the user through the CodeRabbit review process.

1.  **Check Repository Connection**
    - Ensure your repository is connected to CodeRabbit at [https://coderabbit.ai](https://coderabbit.ai).

2.  **Review Latest Changes**
    - CodeRabbit automatically reviews new commits and pull requests.
    - Check for comments on your latest PR or commit.

3.  **Apply Fixes**
    - If CodeRabbit suggests changes, review them.
    - Apply fixes using your preferred method (e.g., `git apply` or manual edits).

4.  **Verify Fixes**
    - Run tests to ensure the fixes didn't break functionality.

**Note**: CodeRabbit runs primarily on the GitHub/GitLab side. This workflow is a reminder and guide to check its output.
