# Anthropic Best Practices

- **Directness**: Be clear and blunt about what the agent should do.
- **Examples**: Provide 2-5 high-quality examples for complex tasks.
- **Negative Constraints**: Explicitly state what NOT to do.
- **Variable Usage**: Use `{{VARIABLE}}` syntax for dynamic parts.
- **XML Tags**: Use XML for structure (e.g., `<thought>`, `<code>`).
