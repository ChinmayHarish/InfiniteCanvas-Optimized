# Persuasion Principles for Prompts

1. **Authority**: Establish the agent as an expert (e.g., "You are a Senior Principal Engineer").
2. **Commitment**: Ask the agent to acknowledge the rules before starting.
3. **Scarcity/Urgency**: (Avoid in technical skills, but useful for performance) "Every token matters."
4. **The "Why"**: Explain the rationale behind a constraint to ensure compliance.
5. **Consistency**: Use the same terminology throughout a skill.
